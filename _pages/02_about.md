# BiG-SCAPE

BiG-SCAPE (Biosynthetic Gene Similarity Clustering and Prospecting Engine) is a Python software package that constructs sequence similarity networks of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) and groups them into gene cluster families (GCFs).

BiG-SCAPE does this by rapidly calculating a distance matrix between gene clusters based on a comparison of their protein domain content, order, copy number, and sequence identity. Outputs of BiG-SCAPE are raw network files as well as a rich graphical user interface in HTML format that can be used to explore the networks and families in your browser.

Learn more about BiG-SCAPE in the [BiG-SCAPE wiki](https://github.com/medema-group/BiG-SCAPE/wiki) and the [publication](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31768033/).

# CORASON

CORASON (CORe Analysis of Syntenic Orthologs to prioritize Natural Product Biosynthetic Gene Clusters) is a visual tool that identifies gene clusters that share a common genomic core, and reconstructs multi-locus phylogenies of these gene clusters to explore their evolutionary relationships. CORASON outputs are newick trees, a core functional report and a graphical output in SVG format, displaying metadata such as gene function and genome coordinates, thus facilitating genomic analysis.

## Contact

BiG-SCAPE and CORASON were developed in a collaboration between the research groups of Francisco (Paco) Barona-Gomez at Cinvestav (Mexico) and Marnix Medema at Wageningen University (The Netherlands). The development of these tools was lead by Jorge Navarro-Mu√±oz and Nelly Selem-Mojica, respectively.
